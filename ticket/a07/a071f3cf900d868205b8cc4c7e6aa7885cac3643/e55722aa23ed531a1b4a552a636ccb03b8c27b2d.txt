The RADIUS Extensions Working Group will focus on extensions to the RADIUS protocol required to expand and enrich the standard attribute space, address  cryptographic algorithm agility, use of new secure transports and clarify its usage and definition.

In order to maintain interoperation of heterogeneous RADIUS/Diameter deployments, all RADEXT WG work items except those that just define new attributes MUST contain a Diameter compatibility section, outlining how interoperability with Diameter will be maintained.

Furthermore, to ensure backward compatibility with existing RADIUS  implementations, as well as compatibility between RADIUS and Diameter, the following restrictions are imposed on extensions considered by the RADEXT WG:

- All documents produced MUST specify means of interoperation with legacy RADIUS and, if possible, be backward compatible with existing RADIUS RFCs, including RFCs 2865-2869, 3162, 3575, 3579, 3580, 4668-4673,4675, 5080, 5090, 5176 and 6158. Transport profiles should, if possible, be compatible with RFC 3539.

Work Items
The immediate goals of the RADEXT working group are to address the following issues:

- RADIUS attribute space extension. The standard RADIUS attribute space is currently being depleted. This document will provide additional standard attribute space, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing attributes.

- IEEE 802 attributes. New attributes have been proposed to support IEEE 802 standards for wired and wireless LANs. This work item will support authentication, authorization and accounting attributes needed by IEEE 802 groups including IEEE 802.1, IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16.

- New RADIUS transports. A reliable transport profile for RADIUS will be developed, as well as specifications for Secure transports, including TCP/TLS (RADSEC) and UDP/DTLS.

- Update and clarification of Network Access Identifiers (RFC4282). This work item will correct and clarify issues present with RFC4282 in two phases.  In first phase, RFC4282bis will be issued to eliminate fundamental incompatibilities with RADIUS around character encoding and NAI modifications by proxies.  In second phase, a fresh review of NAI internationalization requirements and behavior will be undertaken with a clear goal of maintaining compatibility with RADIUS.

- Fragmentation of RADIUS packets to support exchanges exceeding the existing 4KB limit imposed by RFC 2865.
