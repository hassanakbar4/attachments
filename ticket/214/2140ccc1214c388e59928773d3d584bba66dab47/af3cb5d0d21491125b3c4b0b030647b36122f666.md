   * Any remaining comments from any ADs that still need to be addressed?
   * If all of the above, what needs to happy to submit an updated draft?

7. From the mailing list: "What is the canonical procedure to create an "infinite" audio stream, using Opus and FLAC codecs?"
        I have been attempting to locate a site which streams Opus continuously to test.
		I also am interested in the exact opusenc, et al. commands necessary to achieve creation of live audio streams. 
		The use cases are implementation of user-defined Web radio station, the capability to play the "infinite" stream using HTMLAudioElement (WHATWG/HTML) over HTTP. 
		("infinite" is quoted here as there is no way to verify infinity; the gist is playback should not stop; is not seekable).

remaining FFV1 issues from DISCUSS

no remaining issues!
https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFV1/releases/tag/draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-19_v4-16
Matroska issues

much discussion about accurate time stamps, progress in a number of pull requests.

FLAC issues

no focus on this yet.

AOB?

A lot of debate about what we want to do for FFV1 v4.
We will need a focused conversation about this. {have this conversation in Feb. meeting}: April 2021 date is not realistic.
The RFC on FFV1 versions v1 to v3 coming out will be a big motivation for the industry.

Next meeting is: January 26.
