Purpose: For information

Body: We note that 3GPP SA5 is working on Management and orchestration of 5G networks and network slicing (http://www.3gpp.org/NEWS-EVENTS/3GPP-NEWS/1951-SA5_5G) and is considering various existing data models as references.

We would like to take this opportunity to inform you of the status of several pieces of work in the IETF that provide support for network slicing for IP services , L2 services, TE services, and transport networks.

RFC 8299 provides A YANG Data Model for L3VPN Service Delivery.
This document is a published RFC with IETF consensus.
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8299.txt

draft-ietf-l2sm-l2vpn-service-model provides A YANG Data Model for L2VPN Service Delivery.
This document has achieved working group and IETF consensus, and is currently completing approval for publication as an RFC.
https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-l2sm-l2vpn-service-model-10.txt

Two further informational documents developed by the IETF community may help explain this work:

- RFC 8309 sets the previous two documents in context by explaining what the IETF
   means by the term "Service Model"
   https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8309.txt

- RFC 8199 provides a YANG module classification that will also assist you in seeing
   how the IETF's YANG modules fit together.

You may also be interested in work in the TEAS working group on Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered networks (ACTN).
In particular, there is YANG model for Virtual Network operation in an ACTN context that may be of specific interest to you:

Wishing you all success in your work,
