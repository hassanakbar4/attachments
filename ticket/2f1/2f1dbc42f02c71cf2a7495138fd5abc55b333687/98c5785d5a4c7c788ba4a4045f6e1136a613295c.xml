<t>This document provides an overview of operational networking issues
that pertain to quality of experience in streaming of video and other
high-bitrate media over the Internet.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>As the internet has grown, an increasingly large share of the traffic
delivered to end users has become video.  Estimates
put the total share of internet video traffic at 75% in 2019, expected
to grow to 82% by 2022.  This estimate projects the
gross volume of video traffic will more than double during this time,
based on a compound annual growth rate continuing at 34% (from Appendix
D of <xref target="CVNI"/>).</t>

<t>A substantial part of this growth is due to increased use of streaming video, although the amount of video traffic in real-time communications (for example, online videoconferencing) has also grown significantly. While both streaming video and videoconferencing have real-time delivery and latency requirements, these requirements vary from one application to another. For example, videoconferencing demands an end-to-end (one-way) latency of a few hundreds of milliseconds whereas live streaming can tolerate latencies of several seconds.</t>

<t>This document specifically focuses on the streaming applications and defines streaming as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Streaming is transmission of a continuous media from a server to a client and its simultaneous consumption by the client.</t>
  <t>Here, continuous media refers to media and associated streams such as video, audio, metadata, etc. In this definition, the critical term is “simultaneous”, as it is not considered streaming if one downloads a video file and plays it after the download is completed, which would be called download-and-play.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This has two implications.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>First, the server’s transmission rate must (loosely or tightly) match to client’s consumption rate in order to provide uninterrupted playback. That is, the client must not run out of data (buffer underrun) or accept more data than it can buffer before playback (buffer overrun) as any excess media is simply discarded.</t>
  <t>Second, the client’s consumption rate is limited not only by bandwidth availability but also real-time constraints. That is, the client cannot fetch media that is not available from a server yet.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In many contexts, video traffic can be handled transparently as
generic application-level traffic.  However, as the volume of
video traffic continues to grow, it’s becoming increasingly
important to consider the effects of network design decisions
on application-level performance, with considerations for
the impact on video delivery.</t>

<t>This document
focuses on capturing characteristics of video delivery that have
surprised network designers or transport experts without specific
video expertise, since these highlight key differences between common
assumptions in existing networking documents and observations of
video delivery issues in practice.</t>

<t>Making specific recommendations for future work on mitigating these issues
is out of scope, though some existing mitigations are mentioned
in passing.  The intent is to provide a point of reference for
future solution proposals to use in describing how new
technologies address or avoid these existing observed problems.</t>

<section anchor="bvr" title="Video Bitrates">

<t>Video bitrate selection depends on many variables including the resolution (height and width), frame rate, color depth, codec, encoding parameters, scene complexity and amount of motion. Generally speaking, as the resolution, frame rate, color depth, scene complexity and amount of motion increase, the encoding bitrate increases. As newer codecs with better compression tools are used, the encoding bitrate decreases. Similarly, a multi-pass encoding generally produces better quality output compared to single-pass encoding at the same bitrate, or delivers the same quality at a lower bitrate.</t>

<t>Here are a few common resolutions used for video content, with typical ranges of bitrates for the two most popular video codecs <xref target="Encodings"/>.</t>

<section anchor="virtual-reality-bitrates" title="Virtual Reality Bitrates">

<t>The bitrates given in <xref target="bvr"/> describe video streams that provide the user with a single, fixed, point of view - so, the user has no “degrees of freedom”, and the user sees all of the video image that is available.</t>

<t>Even basic virtual reality (360-degree) videos that allow users to look around freely (referred to as “three degrees of freedom”, or 3DoF) require substantially larger bitrates when they are captured and encoded as such videos require multiple fields of view of the scene. The typical multiplication factor is 8 to 10. Yet, due to smart delivery methods such as viewport-based or tiled-based streaming, we do not need to send the whole scene to the user. Instead, the user needs only the portion corresponding to its viewpoint at any given time.</t>

<t>In more immersive applications, where limited user movement (“three degrees of freedom plus”, or 3DoF+) or full user movement (“six degrees of freedom”, or 6DoF) is allowed, the required bitrate grows even further. In this case, immersive content is typically referred to as volumetric media. One way to represent the volumetric media is to use point clouds, where streaming a single object may easily require a bitrate of 30 Mbps or higher. Refer to <xref target="MPEGI"/> and <xref target="PCC"/> for more details.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="path-requirements" title="Path Requirements">

<t>The bitrate requirements in <xref target="scaling"/> are per end-user actively
consuming a media feed, so in the worst case, the bitrate demands
can be multiplied by the number of simultaneous users to find the
bandwidth requirements for a router on the delivery path with that
number of users downstream.  For example, at a node with 10,000
downstream users simultaneously consuming video streams,
approximately 80 Gbps might be necessary in order for all of them
to get typical content at 1080p resolution.</t>

<t>However, when there is some overlap in the feeds being consumed by
end users, it is sometimes possible to reduce the bandwidth
provisioning requirements for the network by performing some kind
of replication within the network.  This can be achieved via object
caching with delivery of replicated objects over individual
connections, and/or by packet-level replication using multicast.</t>

<t>To the extent that replication of popular content can be performed,
bandwidth requirements at peering or ingest points can be reduced to
as low as a per-feed requirement instead of a per-user requirement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="caching-systems" title="Caching Systems">

<t>When demand for content is relatively predictable, and especially when that content is relatively static, caching content close to requesters, and pre-loading caches to respond quickly to initial requests is often useful (for example, HTTP/1.1 caching is described in <xref target="RFC7234"/>). This is subject to the usual considerations for caching - for example, how much data must be cached to make a significant difference to the requester, and how the benefits of caching and pre-loading caches balances against the costs of tracking “stale” content in caches and refreshing that content.</t>

<t>It is worth noting that not all high-demand content is “live” content. One popular example is when popular streaming content can be staged close to a significant number of requesters, as can happen when a new episode of a popular show is released. This content may be largely stable, so low-cost to maintain in multiple places throughout the Internet. This can reduce demands for high end-to-end bandwidth without having to use mechanisms like multicast.</t>

<t>Caching and pre-loading can also reduce exposure to peering point congestion, since less traffic crosses the peering point exchanges if the caches are placed in peer networks, especially when the content can be pre-loaded during off-peak hours, and especially if the transfer can make use of “Lower-Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB) for Differentiated Services” <xref target="RFC8622"/>, “Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT)” <xref target="RFC6817"/>, or similar mechanisms.</t>

<t>All of this depends, of course, on the ability of a content provider to predict usage and provision bandwidth, caching, and other mechanisms to meet the needs of users. In some cases (<xref target="sec-predict"/>), this is relatively routine, but in other cases, it is more difficult (<xref target="sec-unpredict"/>, <xref target="sec-extreme"/>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec-predict" title="Predictable Usage Profiles">

<t>Historical data shows that users consume more video and videos at higher bitrates than they did in the past on their connected devices. Improvements in the codecs that help with reducing the encoding bitrates with better compression algorithms could not have offset the increase in the demand for the higher quality video (higher resolution, higher frame rate, better color gamut, better dynamic range, etc.). In particular, mobile data usage has shown a large jump over the years due to increased consumption of entertainment as well as conversational video.</t>

<t>TBD: insert charts showing historical relative data usage patterns with
error bars by time of day in consumer networks?</t>

<t>TBD: Cross-ref vs. video quality by time of day in practice for some case
study?  Not sure if there’s a good way to capture a generalized insight
here, but it seems worth making the point that demand projections can
be used to help with e.g. power consumption with routing architectures
that provide for modular scalability.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec-unpredict" title="Unpredictable Usage Profiles">

<t>Although TCP/IP has been used with a number of widely used applications that have symmetric bandwidth requirements (similar bandwidth requirements in each direction between endpoints), many widely-used Internet applications operate in client-server roles, with asymmetric bandwidth requirements. A common example might be an HTTP GET operation, where a client sends a relatively small HTTP GET request for a resource to an HTTP server, and often receives a significantly larger response carrying the requested resource. When HTTP is commonly used to stream movie-length video, the ratio between response size and request size can become arbitrarily large.</t>

<t>For this reason, operators may pay more attention to downstream bandwidth utilization when planning and managing capacity. In addition, operators have been able to deploy access networks for end users using underlying technologies that are inherently asymmetric, favoring downstream bandwidth (e.g. ADSL, cellular technologies, most IEEE 802.11 variants), assuming that users will need less upstream bandwidth than downstream bandwidth. This strategy usually works, except when it faiis because application bandwidth usage patterns have changed in ways that were not predicted.</t>

<t>One example of this type of change was when peer-to-peer file sharing applications gained popularity in the early 2000s. To take one well-documented case (<xref target="RFC5594"/>), the Bittorrent application created “swarms” of hosts, uploading and downloading files to each other, rather than communicating with a server. Bittorrent favored peers who uploaded as much as they downloaded, so that new Bittorrent users had an incentive to significantly increase their upstream bandwidth utilization.</t>

<t>The combination of the large volume of “torrents” and the peer-to-peer characteristic of swarm transfers meant that end user hosts were suddenly uploading higher volumes of traffic to more destinations than was the case before Bittorrent. This caused at least one large ISP to attempt to “throttle” these transfers, to mitigate the load that these hosts placed on their network. These efforts were met by increased use of encryption in Bittorrent, similar to an arms race, and set off discussions about “Net Neutrality” and calls for regulatory action.</t>

<t>Especially as end users increase use of video-based social networking applications, it will be helpful for access network providers to watch for increasing numbers of end users uploading significant amounts of content.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec-extreme" title="Extremely Unpredictable Usage Profiles">

<t>The causes of unpredictable usage described in <xref target="sec-unpredict"/> were more or less the result of human choices, but we were reminded during a post-IETF 107 meeting that humans are not always in control, and forces of nature can cause enormous fluctuations in traffic patterns.</t>

<t>In his talk, Sanjay Mishra <xref target="Mishra"/> reported that after the CoViD-19 pandemic broke out in early 2020,</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Comcast’s streaming and web video consumption rose by 38%, with their reported peak traffic up 32% overall between March 1 to March 30,</t>
  <t>AT&amp;T reported a 28% jump in core network traffic (single day in April, as compared to pre stay-at-home daily average traffic), with video accounting for nearly half of all mobile network traffic, while
social networking and web browsing remained the highest percentage (almost a quarter each) of overall mobility traffic, and</t>
  <t>Verizon reported similar trends with video traffic up 36% over an average day (pre COVID-19)}.</t>
</list></t>

<t>We note that other operators saw similar spikes during this time period. Craig Labowitz <xref target="Labovitz"/> reported</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Weekday peak traffic increases over 45%-50% from pre-lockdown levels,</t>
  <t>A 30% increase in upstream traffic over their pre-pandemic levels, and</t>
  <t>A steady increase in the overall volume of DDoS traffic, with amounts exceeding the pre-pandemic levels by 40%. (He attributed this increase to the significant rise in gaming-related DDoS attacks (<xref target="LabovitzDDoS"/>), as gaming usage also increased.)</t>
</list></t>

<t>Subsequently, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a COVID-19 Network Impacts Workshop <xref target="IABcovid"/> in November 2020. Given a larger number of reports and more time to reflect, the following observations from the draft workshop report are worth considering.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Participants describing different types of networks reported different kinds of impacts, but all types of networks saw impacts.</t>
  <t>Mobile networks saw traffic reductions and residential networks saw significant increases.</t>
  <t>Reported traffic increases from ISPs and IXPs over just a few weeks were as big as the traffic growth over the course of a typical year, representing a 15-20% surge in growth to land at a new normal that was much higher than anticipated.</t>
  <t>At DE-CIX Frankfurt, the world’s largest Internet Exchange Point in terms of data throughput, the year 2020 has seen the largest increase in peak traffic within a single year since the IXP was founded in 1995.</t>
  <t>The usage pattern changed significantly as work-from-home and videoconferencing usage peaked during normal work hours, which would have typically been off-peak hours with adults at work and children at school. One might expect that the peak would have had more impact on networks if it had happened during typical evening peak hours for video streaming applications.</t>
  <t>The increase in daytime bandwidth consumption reflected both significant increases in “essential” applications such as videoconferencing and VPNs, and entertainment applications as people watched videos or played games.</t>
  <t>At the IXP-level, it was observed that port utilization increased. This phenomenon is mostly explained by a higher traffic demand from residential users.</t>

<section anchor="latency-considerations" title="Latency Considerations">

<t>Streaming media latency refers to the “glass-to-glass” time duration, which is the delay between the real-life occurrence of an event and the streamed media being appropriately displayed on an end user’s device.  Note that this is different from the network latency (defined as the time for a packet to cross a network from one end to another end) because it includes video encoding/decoding and buffering time, and for most cases also ingest to an intermediate service such as a CDN or other video distribution service, rather than a direct connection to an end user.</t>

<t>Streaming media can be usefully categorized according to the application’s latency requirements into a few rough categories:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>ultra low-latency    (less than 1 second)</t>
  <t>low-latency live     (less than 10 seconds)</t>
  <t>non-low-latency live (10 seconds to a few minutes)</t>
  <t>on-demand            (hours or more)</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="ultra-low-latency" title="Ultra Low-Latency">

<t>Ultra low-latency delivery of media is defined here as having a glass-to-glass delay target under one second.</t>

<t>This level of latency is sometimes necessary for real-time interactive applications such as video conferencing, operation of remote control devices or vehicles, or remotely hosted real-time gaming systems.  Some media content providers aim to achieve this level of latency for live media events involving sports, but have usually so far been unsuccessful over the internet at scale, though it is often possible within a localized environment with a controlled network, such as inside a specific venue connected to the event.  Applications operating in this domain that encounter transient network events such as loss or reordering of some packets often experience user-visible artifacts in the media.</t>

<t>Applications requiring ultra low latency for media delivery are usually tightly constrained on the available choices for media transport technologies, and sometimes may need to operate in controlled environments to reliably achieve their latency and quality goals.</t>

<t>Most applications operating over IP networks and requiring latency this low use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC3550"/> or WebRTC <xref target="RFC8825"/>, which uses RTP for the media transport as well as several other protocols necessary for safe operation in browsers.</t>

<t>Worth noting is that many applications for ultra low-latency delivery do not need to scale to more than one user at a time, which simplifies many delivery considerations relative to other use cases.  For applications that need to replicate streams to multiple users, especially at a scale exceeding tens of users, this level of latency has historically been nearly impossible to achieve except with the use of multicast or planned provisioning in controlled networks.</t>

<t>Recommended reading for applications adopting an RTP-based approach also includes <xref target="RFC7656"/>. For increasing the robustness of the playback by implementing adaptive playout methods, refer to <xref target="RFC4733"/> and <xref target="RFC6843"/>.</t>

<t>Applications with further-specialized latency requirements are out of scope for this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="low-latency-live" title="Low-Latency Live">

<t>Low-latency live delivery of media is defined here as having a glass-to-glass delay target under 10 seconds.</t>

<t>This level of latency is targeted to have a user experience similar to traditional broadcast TV delivery.  A frequently cited problem with failing to achieve this level of latency for live sporting events is the user experience failure from having crowds within earshot of one another who react audibly to an important play, or from users who learn of an event in the match via some other channel, for example social media, before it has happened on the screen showing the sporting event.</t>

<t>Applications requiring low-latency live media delivery are generally feasible at scale with some restrictions.  This typically requires the use of a premium service dedicated to the delivery of live video, and some tradeoffs may be necessary relative to what’s feasible in a higher latency service. The tradeoffs may include higher costs, or delivering a lower quality video, or reduced flexibility for adaptive bitrates, or reduced flexibility for available resolutions so that fewer devices can receive an encoding tuned for their display. Low-latency live delivery is also more susceptible to user-visible disruptions due to transient network conditions than higher latency services.</t>

<t>Implementation of a low-latency live video service can be achieved with the use of low-latency extensions of HLS (called LL-HLS) <xref target="I-D.draft-pantos-hls-rfc8216bis"/> and DASH (called LL-DASH) <xref target="LL-DASH"/>. These extensions use the Common Media Application Format (CMAF) standard <xref target="MPEG-CMAF"/> that allows the media to be packaged into and transmitted in units smaller than segments, which are called chunks in CMAF language. This way, the latency can be decoupled from the duration of the media segments. Without a CMAF-like packaging, lower latencies can only be achieved by using very short segment durations. However, shorter segments means more frequent intra-coded frames and that is detrimental to video encoding quality. CMAF allows us to still use longer segments (improving encoding quality) without penalizing latency.</t>

<t>While an LL-HLS client retrieves each chunk with a separate HTTP GET request, an LL-DASH client uses the chunked transfer encoding feature of the HTTP <xref target="CMAF-CTE"/> which allows the LL-DASH client to fetch all the chunks belonging to a segment with a single GET request. An HTTP server can transmit the CMAF chunks to the LL-DASH client as they arrive from the encoder/packager. A detailed comparison of LL-HLS and LL-DASH is given in <xref target="MMSP20"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="non-low-latency-live" title="Non-Low-Latency Live">

<t>Non-low-latency live delivery of media is defined here as a live stream that does not have a latency target shorter than 10 seconds.</t>

<t>This level of latency is the historically common case for segmented video delivery using HLS <xref target="RFC8216"/> and DASH <xref target="MPEG-DASH"/>. This level of latency is often considered adequate for content like news or pre-recorded content.  This level of latency is also sometimes achieved as a fallback state when some part of the delivery system or the client-side players do not have the necessary support for the features necessary to support low-latency live streaming.</t>

<t>This level of latency can typically be achieved at scale with commodity CDN services for HTTP(s) delivery, and in some cases the increased time window can allow for production of a wider range of encoding options relative to the requirements for a lower latency service without the need for increasing the hardware footprint, which can allow for wider device interoperability.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="on-demand" title="On-Demand">

<t>On-Demand media streaming refers to playback of pre-recorded media based on a user’s action.  In some cases on-demand media is produced as a by-product of a live media production, using the same segments as the live event, but freezing the manifest after the live event has finished.  In other cases, on-demand media is constructed out of pre-recorded assets with no streaming necessarily involved during the production of the on-demand content.</t>

<t>On-demand media generally is not subject to latency concerns, but other timing-related considerations can still be as important or even more important to the user experience than the same considerations with live events.  These considerations include the startup time, the stability of the media stream’s playback quality, and avoidance of stalls and video artifacts during the playback under all but the most severe network conditions.</t>

<t>In some applications, optimizations are available to on-demand video that are not always available to live events, such as pre-loading the first segment for a startup time that doesn’t have to wait for a network download to begin.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="sec-abr" title="Adaptive Encoding, Adaptive Delivery, and Measurement Collection">

<section anchor="overview" title="Overview">

<t>Adaptive BitRate (ABR) is a sort of application-level response strategy in which the streaming client attempts to detect the available bandwidth of the network path by observing the successful application-layer download speed, then chooses a bitrate for each of the video, audio, subtitles and metadata (among the limited number of available options) that fits within that bandwidth, typically adjusting as changes in available bandwidth occur in the network or changes in capabilities occur during the playback (such as available memory, CPU, display size, etc.).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="adapt-encode" title="Adaptive Encoding">

<t>Media servers can provide media streams at various bitrates because the media has been encoded at various bitrates. This is a so-called “ladder” of bitrates, that can be offered to media players as part of the manifest that describes the media being requested by the media player, so that the media player can select among the available bitrate choices.</t>

<t>The media server may also choose to alter which bitrates are made available to players by adding or removing bitrate options from the ladder delivered to the player in subsequent manifests built and sent to the player. This way, both the player, through its selection of bitrate to request from the manifest, and the server, through its construction of the bitrates offered in the manifest, are able to affect network utilization.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="adapt-deliver" title="Adaptive Segmented Delivery">

<t>ABR playback is commonly implemented by streaming clients using HLS <xref target="RFC8216"/> or DASH <xref target="MPEG-DASH"/> to perform a reliable segmented delivery of media over HTTP. Different implementations use different strategies <xref target="ABRSurvey"/>, often relying on proprietary algorithms (called rate adaptation or bitrate selection algorithms) to perform available bandwidth estimation/prediction and the bitrate selection.</t>

<t>Many server-player systems will do an initial probe or a very simple throughput speed test at the start of a video playback. This is done to get a rough sense of the highest video bitrate in the ABR ladder that the network between the server and player will likely be able to provide under initial network conditions. After the initial testing, clients tend to rely upon passive network observations and will make use of player side statistics such as buffer fill rates to monitor and respond to changing network conditions.</t>

<t>The choice of bitrate occurs within the context of optimizing for some metric monitored by the client, such as highest achievable video quality or lowest chances for a rebuffering event (playback stall).</t>

<t>This kind of bandwidth-measurement system can experience trouble in several ways that can be affected by networking design choices. Because adaptive application-level response strategies are typically using application-level protocols, these mechanisms are affected by transport-level protocol behaviors, and the application-level feedback loop is interacting with a transport-level feedback loop, as described in <xref target="idle-time"/> and <xref target="hol-blocking"/>.</t>

<section anchor="idle-time" title="Idle Time between Segments">

<t>When the bitrate selection is chosen substantially below the available capacity of the network path, the response to a segment request will typically complete in much less absolute time than the duration of the requested segment, leaving significant idle time between segment downloads. This can have a few surprising consequences:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>TCP slow-start when restarting after idle requires multiple RTTs to re-establish a throughput at the network’s available capacity.  When the active transmission time for segments is substantially shorter than the time between segments leaving an idle gap between segments that triggers a restart of TCP slow-start, the estimate of the successful download speed coming from the application-visible receive rate on the socket can thus end up much lower than the actual available network capacity, preventing a shift to the most appropriate bitrate. <xref target="RFC7661"/> provides some mitigations for this effect at the TCP transport layer, for senders who anticipate a high incidence of this problem.</t>
  <t>Mobile flow-bandwidth spectrum and timing mapping can be impacted by idle time in some networks. The carrier capacity assigned to a link can vary with activity. Depending on the idle time characteristics, this can result in a lower available bitrate than would be achievable with a steadier transmission in the same network.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Some receive-side ABR algorithms such as <xref target="ELASTIC"/> are designed to try to avoid this effect. Another way to mitigate this effect is by the help of two simultaneous TCP connections is explained in <xref target="MMSys11"/> for Microsoft Smooth Streaming. In some cases, the system-level TCP slow-start restart can be disabled <xref target="OReilly-HPBN"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="hol-blocking" title="Head-of-Line Blocking">

<t>In the event of a lost packet on a TCP connection with SACK
support (a common case for segmented delivery in practice), loss
of a packet can provide a confusing bandwidth signal to the
receiving application.  Because of the sliding window in TCP,
many packets may be accepted by the receiver without being available
to the application until the missing packet arrives.  Upon arrival
of the one missing packet after retransmit, the receiver will
suddenly get access to a lot of data at the same time.</t>

<t>To a receiver measuring bytes received per unit time at the
application layer, and interpreting it as an estimate of the
available network bandwidth, this appears as a high jitter in
the goodput measurement.</t>

<t>It’s worth noting that more modern transport protocols such as QUIC have mitigation of head-of-line blocking as a protocol design goal. See <xref target="quic-behavior"/> for more details.</t>

<section anchor="measure-coll" title="Measurement Collection">

<t>In addition to measurements media players use to guide their segment-by-segment adaptive streaming requests, streaming media providers may also rely on measurements collected from media players to provide analytics that can be used for decisions such as whether the adaptive encoding bitrates in use are the best ones to provide to media players, or whether current media content caching is providing the best experience for viewers.</t>

<t>In addition to measurements media players use to guide their segment-by-segment adaptive streaming requests, streaming media providers may also rely on measurements collected from media players to provide analytics that can be used for decisions such as whether the adaptive encoding bitrates in use are the best ones to provide to media players, or whether current media content caching is providing the best experience for viewers. To that effect, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) who owns the Web Application Video Ecosystem (WAVE) project has published two important specifications.</t>

<section anchor="cta-2066-streaming-quality-of-experience-events-properties-and-metrics" title="CTA-2066: Streaming Quality of Experience Events, Properties and Metrics">

<t><xref target="CTA-2066"/> specifies a set of media player events, properties, quality of experience (QoE) metrics and associated terminology for representing streaming media quality of experience across systems, media players and analytics vendors. While all these events, properties, metrics and associated terminology is used across a number of proprietary analytics and measurement solutions, they were used in slightly (or vastly) different ways that led to interoperability issues. CTA-2066 attempts to address this issue by defining a common terminology as well as how each metric should be computed for consistent reporting.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="cta-5004-common-media-client-data-cmcd" title="CTA-5004: Common Media Client Data (CMCD)">

<t>Many assumes that the CDNs have a holistic view into the health and performance of the streaming clients. However, this is not the case. The CDNs produce millions of log lines per second across hundreds of thousands of clients and they have no concept of a “session” as a client would have, so CDNs are decoupled from the metrics the clients generate and report. A CDN cannot tell which request belongs to which playback session, the duration of any media object, the bitrate, or whether any of the clients have stalled and are rebuffering or are about to stall and will rebuffer. The consequence of this decoupling is that a CDN cannot prioritize delivery for when the client needs it most, prefetch content, or trigger alerts when the network itself may be underperforming. One approach to couple the CDN to the playback sessions is for the clients to communicate standardized media-relevant information to the CDNs while they are fetching data. <xref target="CTA-5004"/> was developed exactly for this purpose.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="unreliable" title="Unreliable Transport">

<t>In contrast to segmented delivery, several applications use unreliable UDP or SCTP with its “partial reliability” extension <xref target="RFC3758"/> to deliver Media encapsulated in RTP <xref target="RFC3550"/> or raw MPEG Transport Stream (“MPEG-TS”)-formatted video <xref target="MPEG-TS"/>, when the media is being delivered in situations such as broadcast and live streaming, that better tolerate occasional packet loss without retransmission.</t>

<t>Under congestion and loss, this approach generally experiences more video artifacts with fewer delay or head-of-line blocking effects. Often one of the key goals is to reduce latency, to better support applications like videoconferencing, or for other live-action video with interactive components, such as some sporting events.</t>

<t>The Secure Reliable Transport protocol <xref target="SRT"/> also uses UDP in an effort to achieve lower latency for streaming media, although it adds reliability at the application layer.</t>

<t>Congestion avoidance strategies for deployments using unreliable transport protocols vary widely in practice, ranging from being entirely unresponsive to congestion, to using feedback signaling to change encoder settings (as in <xref target="RFC5762"/>), to using fewer enhancement layers (as in <xref target="RFC6190"/>), to using proprietary methods to detect “quality of experience” issues and turn off video in order to allow less bandwidth-intensive media such as audio to be delivered.</t>

<t>More details about congestion avoidance strategies used with unreliable transport protocols are included in <xref target="udp-behavior"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="evolution-of-transport-protocols-and-transport-protocol-behaviors" title="Evolution of Transport Protocols and Transport Protocol Behaviors">

<t><spanx style="strong">Note to Reviewers</spanx></t>

<t>This section includes some material on UDP and TCP that may be tutorial for some readers. We can decide how to explain that, if the working group feels that this tutorial material is worth keeping. Spencer thought it was worth including, because it provides a contrast to the material on QUIC, which is significantly less tutorial, unless the reader participated in the QUIC working group.</t>

<t>Because networking resources are shared between users, a good place to start our discussion is how contention between users, and mechanisms to resolve that contention in ways that are “fair” between users, impact streaming media users. These topics are closely tied to transport protocol behaviors.</t>

<t>As noted in <xref target="sec-abr"/>, Adaptive Bitrate response strategies such as HLS <xref target="RFC8216"/> or DASH <xref target="MPEG-DASH"/> are attempting to respond to changing path characteristics, and underlying transport protocols are also attempting to respond to changing path characteristics.</t>

<t>For most of the history of the Internet, these transport protocols, described in <xref target="udp-behavior"/> and <xref target="tcp-behavior"/>, have had relatively consistent behaviors that have changed slowly, if at all, over time. Newly standardized transport protocols like QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> can behave differently from existing transport protocols, and these behaviors may evolve over time more rapidly than currently-used transport protocols.</t>

<t>For this reason, we have included a description of how the path characteristics that streaming media providers may see are likely to evolve over time.</t>

<section anchor="udp-behavior" title="UDP and Its Behavior">

<t>For most of the history of the Internet, we have trusted UDP-based applications to limit their impact on other users. One of the strategies used was to use UDP for simple query-response application protocols, such as DNS, which is often used to send a single-packet request to look up the IP address for a DNS name, and return a single-packet response containing the IP address. Although it is possible to saturate a path between a DNS client and DNS server with DNS requests, in practice, that was rare enough that DNS included few mechanisms to resolve contention between DNS users and other users (whether they are also using DNS, or using other application protocols).</t>

<t>In recent times, the usage of UDP-based applications that were not simple query-response protocols has grown substantially, and since UDP does not provide any feedback mechanism to senders to help limit impacts on other users, application-level protocols such as RTP <xref target="RFC3550"/> have been responsible for the decisions that TCP-based applications have delegated to TCP - what to send, how much to send, and when to send it. So, the way some UDP-based applications interact with other users has changed.</t>

<t>It’s also worth pointing out that because UDP has no transport-layer feedback mechanisms, UDP-based applications that send and receive substantial amounts of information are expected to provide their own feedback mechanisms. This expectation is most recently codified in Best Current Practice <xref target="RFC8085"/>.</t>

<t>RTP relies on RTCP Sender and Receiver Reports <xref target="RFC3550"/> as its own feedback mechanism, and even includes Circuit Breakers for Unicast RTP Sessions <xref target="RFC8083"/> for situations when normal RTP congestion control has not been able to react sufficiently to RTP flows sending at rates that result in sustained packet loss.</t>

<t>The notion of “Circuit Breakers” has also been applied to other UDP applications in <xref target="RFC8084"/>, such as tunneling packets over UDP that are potentially not congestion-controlled (for example, “Encapsulating MPLS in UDP”, as described in <xref target="RFC7510"/>). If streaming media is carried in tunnels encapsulated in UDP, these media streams may encounter “tripped circuit breakers”, with resulting user-visible impacts.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="tcp-behavior" title="TCP and Its Behavior">

<t>For most of the history of the Internet, we have trusted the TCP protocol to limit the impact of applications that sent a significant number of packets, in either or both directions, on other users. Although early versions of TCP were not particularly good at limiting this impact <xref target="RFC0793"/>, the addition of Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance, as described in <xref target="RFC2001"/>, were critical in allowing TCP-based applications to “use as much bandwidth as possible, but to avoid using more bandwidth than was possible”. Although dozens of RFCs have been written refining TCP decisions about what to send, how much to send, and when to send it, since 1988 <xref target="Jacobson-Karels"/> the signals available for TCP senders remained unchanged - end-to-end acknowledgments for packets that were successfully sent and received, and packet timeouts for packets that were not.</t>

<t>The success of the largely TCP-based Internet is evidence that the mechanisms TCP used to achieve equilibrium quickly, at a point where TCP senders do not interfere with other TCP senders for sustained periods of time, have been largely successful. The Internet continued to work even when the specific mechanisms used to reach equilibrium changed over time. Because TCP provides a common tool to avoid contention, as some TCP-based applications like FTP were largely replaced by other TCP-based applications like HTTP, the transport behavior remained consistent.</t>

<t>In recent times, the TCP goal of probing for available bandwidth, and “backing off” when a network path is saturated, has been supplanted by the goal of avoiding growing queues along network paths, which prevent TCP senders from reacting quickly when a network path is saturated. Congestion control mechanisms such as COPA <xref target="COPA18"/> and BBR <xref target="I-D.cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control"/> make these decisions based on measured path delays, assuming that if the measured path delay is increasing, the sender is injecting packets onto the network path faster than the receiver can accept them, so the sender should adjust its sending rate accordingly.</t>

<t>Although TCP protocol behavior has changed over time, the common practice of implementing TCP as part of an operating system kernel has acted to limit how quickly TCP behavior can change. Even with the widespread use of automated operating system update installation on many end-user systems, streaming media providers could have a reasonable expectation that they could understand TCP transport protocol behaviors, and that those behaviors would remain relatively stable in the short term.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="quic-behavior" title="The QUIC Protocol and Its Behavior">

<t>The QUIC protocol, developed from a proprietary protocol into an IETF standards-track protocol <xref target="RFC9000"/>, turns many of the statements made in <xref target="udp-behavior"/> and <xref target="tcp-behavior"/> on their heads.</t>

<t>Although QUIC provides an alternative to the TCP and UDP transport protocols, QUIC is itself encapsulated in UDP. As noted elsewhere in <xref target="gen-encrypt"/>, the QUIC protocol encrypts almost all of its transport parameters, and all of its payload, so any intermediaries that network operators may be using to troubleshoot HTTP streaming media performance issues, perform analytics, or even intercept exchanges in current applications will not work for QUIC-based applications without making changes to their networks. <xref target="stream-encrypt-media"/> describes the implications of media encryption in more detail.</t>

<t>While QUIC is designed as a general-purpose transport protocol, and can carry different application-layer protocols, the current standardized mapping is for HTTP/3 <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-http"/>, which describes how QUIC transport features are used for HTTP. The convention is for HTTP/3 to run over UDP port 443 <xref target="Port443"/> but this is not a strict requirement.</t>

<t>When HTTP/3 is encapsulated in QUIC, which is then encapsulated in UDP, streaming operators (and network operators) might see UDP traffic patterns that are similar to HTTP(S) over TCP. Since earlier versions of HTTP(S) rely on TCP, UDP ports may be blocked for any port numbers that are not commonly used, such as UDP 53 for DNS. Even when UDP ports are not blocked and HTTP/3 can flow, streaming operators (and network operators) may severely rate-limit this traffic because they do not expect to see legitimate high-bandwidth traffic such as streaming media over the UDP ports that HTTP/3 is using.</t>

<t>As noted in <xref target="hol-blocking"/>, because TCP provides a reliable, in-order delivery service for applications, any packet loss for a TCP connection causes “head-of-line blocking”, so that no TCP segments arriving after a packet is lost will be delivered to the receiving application until the lost packet is retransmitted, allowing in-order delivery to the application to continue. As described in <xref target="RFC9000"/>, QUIC connections can carry multiple streams, and when packet losses do occur, only the streams carried in the lost packet are delayed.</t>

<t>A QUIC extension currently being specified (<xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-datagram"/>) adds the capability for “unreliable” delivery, similar to the service provided by UDP, but these datagrams are still subject to the QUIC connection’s congestion controller, providing some transport-level congestion avoidance measures, which UDP does not.</t>

<t>As noted in <xref target="tcp-behavior"/>, there is increasing interest in transport protocol behaviors that responds to delay measurements, instead of responding to packet loss. These behaviors may deliver improved user experience, but in some cases have not responded to sustained packet loss, which exhausts available buffers along the end-to-end path that may affect other users sharing that path. The QUIC protocol provides a set of congestion control hooks that can be use for algorithm agility, and <xref target="RFC9002"/> defines a basic algorithm with transport behavior that is roughly similar to TCP NewReno <xref target="RFC6582"/>. However, QUIC senders can and do unilaterally chose to use different algorithms such as loss-based CUBIC <xref target="RFC8312"/>, delay-based COPA or BBR, or even something completely different</t>

<t>We do have experience with deploying new congestion controllers without melting the Internet (CUBIC is one example), but the point mentioned in <xref target="tcp-behavior"/> about TCP being implemented in operating system kernels is also different with QUIC. Although QUIC can be implemented in operating system kernels, one of the design goals when this work was chartered was “QUIC is expected to support rapid, distributed development and testing of features”, and to meet this expectation, many implementers have chosen to implement QUIC in user space, outside the operating system kernel, and to even distribute QUIC libraries with their own applications.</t>

<t>The decision to deploy a new version of QUIC is relatively uncontrolled, compared to other widely used transport protocols, and this can include new transport behaviors that appear without much notice except to the QUIC endpoints. At IETF 105, Christian Huitema and Brian Trammell presented a talk on “Congestion Defense in Depth” <xref target="CDiD"/>, that explored potential concerns about new QUIC congestion controllers being broadly deployed without the testing and instrumentation that current major content providers routinely include. The sense of the room at IETF 105 was that the current major content providers understood what is at stake when they deploy new congestion controllers, but this presentation, and the related discussion in TSVAREA minutes from IETF 105 (<xref target="tsvarea-105"/>, are still worth a look for new and rapidly growing content providers.</t>

<t>It is worth considering that if TCP-based HTTP traffic and UDP-based HTTP/3 traffic are allowed to enter operator networks on roughly equal terms, questions of fairness and contention will be heavily dependent on interactions between the congestion controllers in use for TCP-base HTTP traffic and UDP-based HTTP/3 traffic.</t>

<t>More broadly, <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-manageability"/> discusses manageability of the QUIC transport protocol, focusing on the implications of QUIC’s design and wire image on network operations involving QUIC traffic. It discusses what network operators can consider in some detail.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="stream-encrypt-media" title="Streaming Encrypted Media">

<t>“Encrypted Media” has at least three meanings:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Media encrypted at the application layer, typically using some sort of Digital Rights Management (DRM) system, and typically remaining encrypted “at rest”, when senders and receivers store it,</t>
  <t>Media encrypted by the sender at the transport layer, and remaining encrypted until it reaches the ultimate media consumer (in this document, referred to as “end-to-end media encryption”), and</t>
  <t>Media encrypted by the sender at the transport layer, and remaining encrypted until it reaches some intermediary that is <spanx style="emph">not</spanx> the ultimate media consumer, but has credentials allowing decryption of the media content. This intermediary may examine and even transform the media content in some way, before forwarding re-encrypted media content (in this document referred to as “hop-by-hop media encryption”)</t>
</list></t>

<t>Both “hop-by-hop” and “end-to-end” encrypted transport may carry media that is, in addition, encrypted at the application layer.</t>

<t>Each of these encryption strategies is intended to achieve a different goal. For instance, application-level encryption may be used for business purposes, such as avoiding piracy or enforcing geographic restrictions on playback, while transport-layer encryption may be used to prevent media steam manipulation or to protect manifests.</t>

<t>This document does not take a position on whether those goals are “valid” (whatever that might mean).</t>

<t>In this document, we will focus on media encrypted at the transport layer, whether encrypted “hop-by-hop” or “end-to-end”. Because media encrypted at the application layer will only be processed by application-level entities, this encryption does not have transport-layer implications.</t>

<t>Both “End-to-End” and “Hop-by-Hop” media encryption have specific implications for streaming operators. These are described in <xref target="hop-by-hop-encrypt"/> and <xref target="e2em-encrypt"/>.</t>

<section anchor="gen-encrypt" title="General Considerations for Media Encryption">

<t>The use of strong encryption does provide confidentiality for encrypted streaming media, from the sender to either an intermediary or the ultimate media consumer, and this does prevent Deep Packet Inspection by any intermediary that does not possess credentials allowing decryption. However, even encrypted content streams may be vulnerable to traffic analysis. An intermediary that can identify an encrypted media stream without decrypting it, may be able to “fingerprint” the encrypted media stream of known content, and then match the targeted media stream against the fingerprints of known content. This protection can be lessened if a media provider is repeatedly encrypting the same content. <xref target="CODASPY17"/> is an example of what is possible when identifying HTTPS-protected videos over TCP transport, based either on the length of entire resources being transferred, or on characteristic packet patterns at the beginning of a resource being transferred.</t>

<t>If traffic analysis is successful at identifying encrypted content and associating it with specific users, this breaks privacy as certainly as examining decrypted traffic.</t>

<t>Because HTTPS has historically layered HTTP on top of TLS, which is in turn layered on top of TCP, intermediaries do have access to unencrypted TCP-level transport information, such as retransmissions, and some carriers exploited this information in attempts to improve transport-layer performance <xref target="RFC3135"/>. The most recent standardized version of HTTPS, HTTP/3 <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-http"/>, uses the QUIC protocol <xref target="RFC9000"/> as its transport layer. QUIC relies on the TLS 1.3 initial handshake <xref target="RFC8446"/> only for key exchange <xref target="RFC9001"/>, and encrypts almost all transport parameters itself, with the exception of a few invariant header fields. In the QUIC short header, the only transport-level parameter which is sent “in the clear” is the Destination Connection ID <xref target="RFC8999"/>, and even in the QUIC long header, the only transport-level parameters sent “in the clear” are the Version, Destination Connection ID, and Source Connection ID. For these reasons, HTTP/3 is significantly more “opaque” than HTTPS with HTTP/1 or HTTP/2.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="hop-by-hop-encrypt" title="Considerations for “Hop-by-Hop” Media Encryption">

<t>Although the IETF has put considerable emphasis on end-to-end streaming media encryption, there are still important use cases that require the insertion of intermediaries.</t>

<t>There are a variety of ways to involve intermediaries, and some are much more intrusive than others.</t>

<t>From a content provider’s perspective, a number of considerations are in play. The first question is likely whether the content provider intends that intermediaries are explicitly addressed from endpoints, or whether the content provider is willing to allow intermediaries to “intercept” streaming content transparently, with no awareness or permission from either endpoint.</t>

<t>If a content provider does not actively work to avoid interception by intermediaries, the effect will be indistinguishable from “impersonation attacks”, and endpoints cannot be assumed of any level of privacy.</t>

<t>Assuming that a content provider does intend to allow intermediaries to participate in content streaming, and does intend to provide some level of privacy for endpoints, there are a number of possible tools, either already available or still being specified. These include</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Server And Network assisted DASH <xref target="MPEG-DASH-SAND"/> - this specification introduces explicit messaging between DASH clients and network elements or between various network elements for the purpose of improving the efficiency of streaming sessions by providing information about real-time operational characteristics of networks, servers, proxies, caches, CDNs, as well as DASH client’s performance and status.</t>
  <t>“Double Encryption Procedures for the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP)” <xref target="RFC8723"/> - this specification provides a cryptographic transform for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol that provides both hop-by-hop and end-to-end security guarantees.</t>
  <t>Secure Media Frames <xref target="SFRAME"/> - <xref target="RFC8723"/> is closely tied to SRTP, and this close association impeded widespread deployment, because it could not be used for the most common media content delivery mechanisms. A more recent proposal, Secure Media Frames <xref target="SFRAME"/>, also provides both hop-by-hop and end-to-end security guarantees, but can be used with other transport protocols beyond SRTP.</t>
</list></t>

<t>If a content provider chooses not to involve intermediaries, this choice should be carefully considered. As an example, if media manifests are encrypted end-to-end, network providers who had been able to lower offered quality and reduce on their networks will no longer be able to do that. Some resources that might inform this consideration are in <xref target="RFC8825"/> (for WebRTC) and <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-manageability"/> (for HTTP/3 and QUIC).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="e2em-encrypt" title="Considerations for “End-to-End” Media Encryption">

<t>“End-to-end” media encryption offers the potential of providing privacy for streaming media consumers, with the idea being that if an unauthorized intermediary can’t decrypt streaming media, the intermediary can’t use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to examine HTTP request and response headers and identify the media content being streamed.</t>

<t>“End-to-end” media encryption has become much more widespread in the years since the IETF issued “Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack” <xref target="RFC7258"/> as a Best Current Practice, describing pervasive monitoring as a much greater threat than previously appreciated. After the Snowden disclosures, many content providers made the decision to use HTTPS protection - HTTP over TLS - for most or all content being delivered as a routine practice, rather than in exceptional cases for content that was considered “sensitive”.</t>

<t>Unfortunately, as noted in <xref target="RFC7258"/>, there is no way to prevent pervasive monitoring by an “attacker”, while allowing monitoring by a more benign entity who “only” wants to use DPI to examine HTTP requests and responses in order to provide a better user experience. If a modern encrypted transport protocol is used for end-to-end media encryption, intermediary streaming operators are unable to examine transport and application protocol behavior. As described in <xref target="hop-by-hop-encrypt"/>, only an intermediary streaming operator who is explicitly authorized to examine packet payloads, rather than intercepting packets and examining them without authorization, can continue these practices.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC7258"/> said that “The IETF will strive to produce specifications that mitigate pervasive monitoring attacks”, so streaming operators should expect the IETF’s direction toward preventing unauthorized monitoring of IETF protocols to continue for the forseeable future.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable
   in a transport for HTTP, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow
   control, and low-latency connection establishment.  This document
   describes a mapping of HTTP semantics over QUIC.  This document also
   identifies HTTP/2 features that are subsumed by QUIC, and describes
   how HTTP/2 extensions can be ported to HTTP/3.

DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF HTTP

   DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF HTTP/3 UNTIL IT IS IN AN RFC.  This
   version is still a work in progress.  For trial deployments, please
   use earlier versions.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm.  BBR
   uses recent measurements of a transport connection&#39;s delivery rate
   and round-trip time to build an explicit model that includes both the
   maximum recent bandwidth available to that connection, and its
   minimum recent round-trip delay.  BBR then uses this model to control
   both how fast it sends data and the maximum amount of data it allows
   in flight in the network at any time.  Relative to loss-based
   congestion control algorithms such as Reno [RFC5681] or CUBIC
   [draft-ietf-tcpm-cubic], BBR offers substantially higher throughput
   for bottlenecks with shallow buffers or random losses, and
   substantially lower queueing delays for bottlenecks with deep buffers
   (avoiding &quot;bufferbloat&quot;).  This algorithm can be implemented in any
   transport protocol that supports packet-delivery acknowledgment (thus
   far, open source implementations are available for TCP [RFC793] and
   QUIC [draft-ietf-quic-transport-00]).

<abstract><t>This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

Instead, compliant implementations taking part in out-of-band negotiations of media stream content indicate what events they support.

The goals of the workshop were twofold: to understand the technical problems that ISPs and end users are experiencing as a result of high volumes of P2P traffic, and to begin to understand how the IETF may be helpful in addressing these problems.  Gaining an understanding of where in the IETF this work might be pursued and how to extract feasible work items were highlighted as important tasks in pursuit of the latter goal.  The workshop was very well attended and produced several work items that have since been taken up by members of the IETF community.   This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This memo describes an RTP payload format for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) as defined in Annex G of ITU-T Recommendation H.264, which is technically identical to Amendment 3 of ISO/IEC International Standard 14496-10.  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit in multiple RTP packets. Furthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP sessions.  The payload format defines a new media subtype name &quot;H264-SVC&quot;, but is still backward compatible to RFC 6184 since the base layer, when encapsulated in its own RTP stream, must use the H.264 media subtype name (&quot;H264&quot;) and the packetization method specified in RFC 6184.  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>

LEDBAT is designed for use by background bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than standard TCP congestion control (as specified in RFC 5681) and to yield in the presence of competing flows, thus limiting interference with the network performance of competing flows.

<title>Multimedia Congestion Control: Circuit Breakers for Unicast RTP Sessions</title>

<date month='March' year='2017'/>
<abstract><t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony, video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications are often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control is not implemented in these applications, then network congestion can lead to uncontrolled packet loss and a resulting deterioration of the user's multimedia experience.  The congestion control algorithm acts as a safety measure by stopping RTP flows from using excessive resources and protecting the network from overload.  At the time of this writing, however, while there are several proprietary solutions, there is no standard algorithm for congestion control of interactive RTP flows.</t><t>This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm.  It instead defines a minimal set of RTP circuit breakers: conditions under which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data to protect the network from excessive congestion.  It is expected that, in the absence of long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications running on best-effort IP networks will be able to operate without triggering these circuit breakers.  To avoid triggering the RTP circuit breaker, any Standards Track congestion control algorithms defined for RTP will need to operate within the envelope set by these RTP circuit breaker algorithms.</t></abstract>

The primary objective of this LE PHB is to protect Best-Effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with the default PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations, i.e., when resources become scarce, BE traffic has precedence over LE traffic and may preempt it.  Alternatively, packets forwarded by the LE PHB can be associated with a scavenger service class, i.e., they scavenge otherwise-unused resources only.  There are numerous uses for this PHB, e.g., for background traffic of low precedence, such as bulk data transfers with low priority in time, non-time-critical backups, larger software updates, web search engines while gathering information from web servers and so on.
